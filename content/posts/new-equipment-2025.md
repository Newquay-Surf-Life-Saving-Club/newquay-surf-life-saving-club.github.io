![New rescue boards](https://placehold.co/800x400?text=New+Equipment)

We're thrilled to announce the arrival of our new rescue equipment! Thanks to a generous grant from the Cornwall Community Foundation and fundraising efforts by our members, we've been able to purchase:

- 6 new rescue boards
- 12 rescue tubes
- 4 competition racing skis
- 20 junior nipper boards

## Equipment Benefits

This new equipment will significantly enhance our training capabilities and ensure our members have access to high-quality, modern equipment for both training and competitions.

The rescue boards and tubes are the same models used by RNLI lifeguards on beaches throughout Cornwall, giving our members experience with professional-grade equipment.

## Equipment Usage Guidelines

To ensure the longevity of our new equipment:

1. All equipment must be rinsed with fresh water after use
2. Boards and skis should be stored on racks, not on the ground
3. Any damage should be reported immediately to the equipment officer
4. Junior members must be supervised when using equipment
5. Equipment sign-out procedures must be followed

## Training with New Equipment

Our coaches will be running special sessions to familiarize members with the new equipment. These sessions will be announced in the coming weeks.

## Thank You

A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our equipment fundraising campaign, particularly:

- Cornwall Community Foundation
- Newquay Town Council
- The Smith Family Foundation
- All members who participated in sponsored events

The new equipment will be available for training starting next week. We can't wait to see you all making the most of these fantastic new resources!
