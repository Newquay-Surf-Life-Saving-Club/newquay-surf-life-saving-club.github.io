We're excited to announce that our summer training schedule for 2025 is now available. Sessions will begin on April 15th and run through September.

## Schedule Highlights

- **Junior sessions** (ages 8-13) will run on Mondays and Saturdays
- **Youth sessions** (ages 14-18) will run on Tuesdays and Saturdays
- **Senior sessions** will run on Wednesdays and Saturdays
- **Pool training** for all age groups will continue on Thursdays

## New for 2025

This year, we're introducing several new elements to our training program:

1. **Specialized Skills Workshops** - Monthly workshops focusing on specific skills like board rescue, tube rescue, and beach flags technique
2. **Competition Preparation Sessions** - Dedicated sessions for those interested in competing
3. **Parent & Child Sessions** - Special Saturday sessions once a month where parents can join in with their children

## Equipment Requirements

All members should bring:
- Wetsuit
- Swimming costume
- Club cap
- Towel
- Water bottle
- Sun protection

The club will provide all necessary training equipment including boards, tubes, and flags.

## Registration

All members must re-register for summer training, even if you've been attending winter sessions. This helps us plan appropriate coach-to-athlete ratios.

Registration can be completed:
- Online through your member portal
- In person at the clubhouse during opening hours
- By emailing training@nslsc.org.uk

## Volunteer Coaches Needed

We're always looking for parent volunteers to assist with training sessions. No experience necessary as training will be provided. If you're interested in helping, please contact our Head Coach at coach@nslsc.org.uk.

We look forward to seeing everyone on the beach for another fantastic summer season!
